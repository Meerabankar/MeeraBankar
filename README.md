#### Data Science and Analytics | University of Oklahoma

I am Data Science and Analytics graduate student at the University of Oklahoma, Norman. I am actively learning the concepts, techniques, terms in this field. I have 5 years' experience in the field of data warehousing in Synechron Tehnologies pvt. ltd., Pune, India as an ETL engineer. During this 5 years tenure at Synechron Technologies I performed data validation, data analysis, data staging, SQL scripting, SQL query analysis and that helped me to get the better understanding of various kinds of data.

As a part of my role as ETL resource building data warehouses after thorough quality checks and getting involved in Descriptive Analytics, I was intrigued to do something big in analytics and machine learning stream. While learning, I have developed few predictive modeling projects using R, python programming languages and I am still digging deeper in the machine learning and advanced data analytics concepts.



## Projects:

#### Bank Marketing (June 2020 to July 2020)

Marketing is part of every product based company as it is important to promote the product and reach out to as many customers as possible in a shorter amount of time. As per a study in 2016, most of the companies invest 8.5% of the total budget in marketing and of that 8.5% marketing budget, 37.5% is used for digital marketing, and the percentage is increased from 37.5% to 55% in just 3 years, and it may go up to 60 to 70% in coming few years. Hence, to get a higher return on investment, it is important to know the correct marketing strategies that can give an idea about which customers to target. 
So, the predictive model implemented in this project does exactly the same thing, it predicts if a customer will purchase the product or not. As this project is implemented on campaign data conducted by a Portuguese bank via phone calls, it has different features that include customers' personal, professional information, and economy-related information. The model is built with XGBoost, SVM, and RandomForest Classifier and is evaluated with F1-Score, AUC and it is 92% accurate in predicting if a customer will purchase a financial product or not in Portuguese bank.
This model can be used in real-time for getting the list of customers who will possibly subscribe to the product as this model is 92% accurate in predicting the possibility and that way it will help companies to modify their marketing strategies in such a way that there will be more ROI.

#### Collision and collision Severity prediction in Oklahoma state to improve state highways (January 2020 to May 2020)

Each year in Oklahoma state, there are about 76,000 car collisions. In these collisions, about 700 people are killed, and about 44,000 people are injured. Statistically speaking, that's roughly 1 in 100 collisions where a person is killed and roughly 1 in 2 collisions where a person is injured. Oklahoma state highway authorities are continuously working on to improve the state roadways by studying the possible reasons behind collisions in areas where maximum collisions are happening. 
The predictive model implemented predicts the collisions and collision severity in Oklahoma state based on various categories related to road condition, weather condition, driver condition, daytime, vehicle condition, etc. The real-time Oklahoma state collision data from the Oklahoma Department of Transportation (ODOT) is used to train and test the model, it also contains weather data collected from Mesonet stations in Oklahoma. Model is built with different classification machine learning algorithms Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network, and KNN classifier, the model is evaluated on F1-Score, ROC and it is 94% accurate in predicting the severity. 

This model will help in reducing the collisions up to a great extent if used to get the collision and collision severity predictions in real-time.

#### Amazon Toy Recommendation System (August 2019 to November 2019)

A recommendation system with advanced features to recommend similar and relevant products to customers with the use of Apriori and clustering algorithms. This project is implemented based on the customers' toy products purchase history from the amazon, the model implemented can be used in real-time for recommending the products for any e-commerce site. The model recommends different yet relevant products based on various features and categories. It is implemented using the Python K-means clustering algorithm, Apriori data mining algorithm, DBSCAN algorithm.

#### Fraud Transaction Detection (May 2019 to July 2019)

Purpose of this project is to build a predictive model to identify or predict the abnormal or fraud transactions to avoid future financial loss as well as to improve the financial security for the customers. Implemented a classification model(89% accuracy) to predict fraud transactions based on customers’ transaction history, purchase patterns. Model is trained on PCA features as data is confidential. Model is built with SVM, decision tree, ANN, Random Forest & evaluated with F1-score, accuracy.

#### Object identification using CNN (Feb 2019 – April 2019)
A predictive model to identify objects from images is built using CNN, deep learning and trained on various object images with different training parameters such as dropouts, epochs, validations, batch_normalization, bias, regularization parameter, activation functions ELU, Sigmoid. Performed cross-validation to get the better performing parameters and the model is evaluated with AUC. Model is 86% accurate in predicting the objects from the image. 
Better accuracy can be achieved with larger data set.



#### Predict abnormality of body parts (Mar 2019 – May 2019)

-Implemented a machine learning algorithm to identify abnormality of different body parts such as hands, shoulder, humerus, fingers, forearm, elbow, wrist from x-ray images image using functional API with CNN and dense neural network with cross entropy, activation functions RELU and sigmoid. The module is trained on different body part images with normal and abnormal body part images and then used for predicting the abnormality with the probabilit. Model is evaluated ROC and the accuracy of prediction Model is 85% accurate in predicting the abnormality.

The purpose of this project is to build a predictive model that will do work of radiologists i.e.e to identify the abnormality of body parts from radiographs so that patients will get treated as early as they should be.  Implemented a machine learning predictive model (86% accurate) in Python Keras/TensorFlow to identify abnormality of different body parts form x-ray images using CNN, ANN with functional API approach. Performance for different parameters was recorded while execution and accordingly modifications to Functional API were done to get the better accuracy. More data is needed to get the better accuracy.

#### Home Credit Risk Prediction_(Oct 2018 - Dec 2018)

-Implemented a predictive model to predict the customers who can repay their loan. Model is trained on many other features such as credit history, repayment pattern, property, job type, salary, investments, etc. Data munging is done by outlier handling, imputation, transformations, feature engineering. Model is built using Logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and SVM, CV methods in R programming language. Results of all these models were compared and best fit model is used for predicting output on test data. All these models are evaluated using accuracy, ROC, cumulative gains chart metrics.




#### Customer Existence prediction using ANN (Jan 2019 - Mar 2019)

-The main goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will stay active at bank at the end of particular year based on historical data of customer. Created a neural network with Keras with multiple hidden layers and trained it with different activation functions such as Sigmoid, Relu and evaluated with F1 Score and accuracy.
