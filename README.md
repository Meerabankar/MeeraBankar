Data Science and Analytics

Hello All,

I am a Data Science and Analytics graduate student at the University of Oklahoma. I am actively learning machine learning, predictive modeling. I have 5+ years of experience in the data warehousing field. I have implemented machine learning, predictive modeling projects with R, Python, Tensorflow, Keras using supervised and unsupervised learning. 



## My Projects:

Home Credit Risk Prediction                                                                                       Oct 2018 - Dec 2018

-Implemented a predictive model to predict the customers who can repay their loan. Model is trained on many other features such as credit history, repayment pattern, property, job type, salary, investments, etc. Data munging is done by outlier handling, imputation, transformations, feature engineering. Model is built using Logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and SVM, CV methods in R programming language. Results of all these models were compared and best fit model is used for predicting output on test data. All these models are evaluated using accuracy, ROC, cumulative gains chart metrics.



Object identification using CNN                                                                                   Dec 2018 – Feb 2019

-Implemented a machine learning algorithm to identify object from image using CNN. The module is trained on different objects with cross entropy, activation functions RELU and sigmoid. Model is 85% accurate in predicting the object.



Customer Existence prediction using ANN                                                                           Jan 2019 - Mar 2019

-The main goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will stay active at bank at the end of particular year based on historical data of customer. Created a neural network with Keras with multiple hidden layers and trained it with different activation functions such as Sigmoid, Relu and evaluated with MSE and accuracy.



Secure Remote User Authentication                                                                                 Jul 2011 - Jun 2012

-It is a client and server application which provides mutual authentication for users with high security developed in C#. 



Gas Agency Management System                                                                                       Jan 2011 - Jul 2011

-An application for Gas Agency to manage operations at Gas Agencies developed in Java and MS Access.


Predict abnormality of body parts                                                                                   Mar 2019 – May 2019

-Implemented a machine learning algorithm to identify abnormality of different body parts such as hands, shoulder, humerus, fingers, forearm, elbow, wrist from x-ray images image using functional API with CNN and dense neural network with cross entropy, activation functions RELU and sigmoid. The module is trained on different body part images with normal and abnormal body part images and then used for predicting the abnormality with the probabilit. Model is evaluated ROC and the accuracy of prediction Model is 85% accurate in predicting the abnormality.
