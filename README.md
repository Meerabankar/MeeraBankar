#### Data Science and Analytics | University of Oklahoma

I am Data Science and Analytics graduate student at the University of Oklahoma, Norman. I am actively learning the concepts, techniques, terms in this field. I have 5 years' experience in the field of data warehousing in Synechron Tehnologies pvt. ltd., Pune, India as an ETL engineer. During this 5 years tenure at Synechron Technologies I performed data validation, data analysis, data staging, SQL scripting, SQL query analysis and that helped me to get the better understanding of various kinds of data.

As a part of my role as ETL resource building data warehouses after thorough quality checks and getting involved in Descriptive Analytics, I was intrigued to do something big in analytics and machine learning stream. While learning, I have developed few predictive modeling projects using R, python programming languages and I am still digging deep the machine learning and advanced data analytics concepts.



## Projects:

### Home Credit Risk Prediction______________________________________________________________________Oct 2018 - Dec 2018

-Implemented a predictive model to predict the customers who can repay their loan. Model is trained on many other features such as credit history, repayment pattern, property, job type, salary, investments, etc. Data munging is done by outlier handling, imputation, transformations, feature engineering. Model is built using Logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, and SVM, CV methods in R programming language. Results of all these models were compared and best fit model is used for predicting output on test data. All these models are evaluated using accuracy, ROC, cumulative gains chart metrics.



### Object identification using CNN__________________________________________________________________Dec 2018 – Feb 2019

-Implemented a machine learning algorithm to identify object from image using CNN. The module is trained on different objects with cross entropy, activation functions RELU and sigmoid. Model is 85% accurate in predicting the object.



### Customer Existence prediction using ANN___________________________________________________________Jan 2019 - Mar 2019

-The main goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will stay active at bank at the end of particular year based on historical data of customer. Created a neural network with Keras with multiple hidden layers and trained it with different activation functions such as Sigmoid, Relu and evaluated with MSE and accuracy.



### Secure Remote User Authentication__________________________________________________________________Jul 2011 - Jun 2012

-It is a client and server application which provides mutual authentication for users with high security developed in C#. 



### Gas Agency Management System_______________________________________________________________________Jan 2011 - Jul 2011

-An application for Gas Agency to manage operations at Gas Agencies developed in Java and MS Access.


### Predict abnormality of body parts__________________________________________________________________Mar 2019 – May 2019

-Implemented a machine learning algorithm to identify abnormality of different body parts such as hands, shoulder, humerus, fingers, forearm, elbow, wrist from x-ray images image using functional API with CNN and dense neural network with cross entropy, activation functions RELU and sigmoid. The module is trained on different body part images with normal and abnormal body part images and then used for predicting the abnormality with the probabilit. Model is evaluated ROC and the accuracy of prediction Model is 85% accurate in predicting the abnormality.
